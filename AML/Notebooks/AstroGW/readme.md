## What will you find here?
 - This folder contains essentially python notebooks made to help visualize gravitational waves and their effects.
 - The assignments are left by prof. Alberto Sesana teaching Astrophysics of Gravitational Waves course @ Unimib
## The solutions are not complete 
 - Since I'm nterested in GW detection for research purposes I will (if I have spear time) keep updating these exercises and making them more complete
### Exercises
1. LAL_vs_AN  $\to$ comparison between GW150914 signal generated with LALSim and computed with Post-Newtonian equations
2. RingMasses $\to$ let's see what happens to N masses on a ring as a GW passes through them
